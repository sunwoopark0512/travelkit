# TravelKit Project Overview

## 1. Vision
**TravelKit** is a mobile-first travel companion app designed to optimize the travel experience through smart packing lists, itinerary management, and exclusive travel offers.
Our goal is to create a seamless "Revenue Feature Loop" where user engagement directly drives value and revenue.

## 2. Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose)
- **Backend**: (TBD - currently local/mock)
- **Governance**: Zero-Touch Governance (Role Contract + Gate + Evidence)
- **Data Source**: Local JSON / Future API

## 3. Key Loops
1.  **Governance Loop**: Experiment -> PR -> Evidence -> Oracle PASS -> Merge.
2.  **Revenue Loop**: User Action -> Trigger -> Offer/Conversion -> Measurement -> Optimization.

## 4. Current State
- **Phase**: Governance Hardening (Locked)
- **Next**: Revenue Feature Implementation
- **Status**: Stable / Ready for Features
