# Skills Index

This repo contains reusable "skills" modules.

## List
- (TODO) Add links to each skill module and its run instructions.

## Rules
- Each skill MUST include:
  - Purpose
  - Inputs/Outputs
  - How to run (Windows PowerShell + bash if applicable)
  - Required env vars (names only; never store secrets)
  - Safety note: no Secrets/Token/PII
