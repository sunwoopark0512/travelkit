# Concept: Stitch Ideation Workflow

## Mental Model
Stitch is an **Ideation Engine**, not just a code generator.
- **Formula**: `Idea + Theme + Content + (Optional Image)`.
- **Iteration**: Don't aim for perfection in prompt #1. Generate, then refine one major change at a time.
- **Thinking**: It converts semantic intent ("make it edgy") into design tokens (hex codes, fonts).

## Misconceptions
- **Myth**: You must specify exact pixels or hex codes in the first prompt.
- **Reality**: You should describe the "Vibe" or "Theme" (e.g., "Modern, high contrast"). Stitch handles the specifics.
- **Myth**: You resize the window to change device types.
- **Reality**: You must "Translate" the design by reprompting for standard device constraints (e.g., "Consolidate tabs for Desktop").

## Gold Questions
Q: What is the recommended formula for a starting prompt in Stitch?
A: Idea + Theme + Content + (Optional Reference Image).

Q: How should you handle major design changes?
A: Make one major change at a time using specific UI/UX keywords.

Q: What is the "Redesign" mode best for?
A: Modernizing old apps or applying specific "Vibes" (e.g., Bento Grid, Glassmorphism) to an existing structure.
