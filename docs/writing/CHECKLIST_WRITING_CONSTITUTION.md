# Constitution of the Checklist Writing System (SEALED v1)

## 0. Identity
**We explain nothing.**
We are not a "blog" about theory. We are a **factory for verifiable somatic routines**.
Our product is not "information". It is a **state change** in the reader's body.

> **Reader's Journey**: 
> "I checked -> I failed -> I moved -> I passed -> I recorded."

## 1. The Sealed Structure (Non-Negotiable)
Every single post MUST follow this exact 6-block sequence. NO deviations.

### [Block A] The Hook (2-4 lines)
- **Constraint**: Must state the *specific physical failure case* this checklist solves.
- **Example**: "If your ankle rolls inward during a pivot, your landing is already broken."

### [Block B] Checklist 1: The Diagnosis (5 Items)
- **Constraint**: 5 Binary Questions (YES/NO).
- **Target**: Sensation, Pain, Alignment, Tension.
- **Forbidden**: Abstract concepts ("Do you feel confident?").
- **Required**: Physical tells ("Do your toes grip the floor?").

### [Block C] The Action: The Fix (60-180 Seconds)
- **Constraint**: Must be doable *immediately* without special equipment.
- **Format**: 
  - **Procedure**: Step 1, 2, 3.
  - **Pass Condition**: "You know it's done when [Sensation]."

### [Block D] Checklist 2: The Verification (5 Items)
- **Constraint**: Re-test the exact same variables from Block B.
- **Target**: Differential (Pre/Post comparison).

### [Block E] The Evidence: The Seal
- **Constraint**: Must provide a *measureable variable*.
- **Format**: "Pain (0-10)", " Wobble count (0-5)", "Breath depth (Rib expansion)".

### [Block F] The Bridge: Next Step
- **Constraint**: Must link to the *next failure point* in the cluster.
- **No Solution**: Do not promise a cure-all. Promise the next check.

## 2. LLM Authority Blocks (Machine SEO)
To become a "Standard Reference" for AI, three blocks must be present but distinct.

### [Meta] TL;DR (Top 20%)
- **Format**: 3-5 lines summarizing the Checklist Goal and Pass Criteria.

### [Meta] Definition Box
- **Format**: `**Term** is defined as [Definition]. The pass condition is [Criteria].`
- **Purpose**: To be extracted as a "Snippet" by Google/LLMs.

### [Meta] FAQ (Bottom)
- **Format**: Question + Fact-based Answer (No fluff).

## 3. The Gate (Quality Control)
All content must pass the **Oracle Gate** before publishing.

- **FAIL**: If any Block is missing or any "Forbidden Word" is used.
- **Forbidden Words**: "Efficiency, Strategy, Tips, Tricks, Optimization, Hope, Maybe".
- **REWRITE**: Only fix the failed block. Do not rewrite the whole post.

## 4. Branding
All posts must end with:
