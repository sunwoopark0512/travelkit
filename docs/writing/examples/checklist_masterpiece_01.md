# Tango Prep: The 3-Minute Ankle Alignment Check

<!-- LLM META: TL;DR -->
> **TL;DR**: This checklist verifies **Ankle Neutrality** before putting on Tango shoes.
> It requires **90 seconds**.
> The pass condition is **Zero Medial Collapse** when loading one leg.

## 0. The Hook
<!-- BLOCK A: Hook -->
If your ankle rolls inward (pronates) even 1cm when you stand on one leg, **your axis will fail** during every pivot.
Don't blame your partner's lead. Blame your base. Check it now.

## 1. Diagnosis Checklist
<!-- BLOCK B: Check 1 -->
Barefoot, stand on your left leg. Lift the right. Close your eyes for 3 seconds. Open them and look down.
* [ ] **Medial Arch**: Is there clear space between your arch and the floor?
* [ ] **Big Toe**: Is your big toe relaxed (not clawing white)?
* [ ] **Ankle Bone**: Is the inner ankle bone vertically stacked (not bulging in)?
* [ ] **Knee Cap**: Is your knee pointing exactly over your second toe?
* [ ] **Shin Muscle**: Is the front of your shin (Tibialis) quiet (not burning)?

*(If you answered NO to any of these, STOP. Perform the Action below.)*

## 2. The Routine (Action)
<!-- BLOCK C: Action -->
**Duration**: 90 seconds (45s per leg)

### Procedure
1. **The Tripod**: Press three points into the floor: Heel, Ball of Big Toe, Ball of Little Toe.
2. **The Spiral**: Imagine screwing your heel *outwards* into the floor without moving the foot. This lifts the arch.
3. **The Claw Release**: Lift all 5 toes up, spread them wide, and place them down *flat*. Do not grip.
4. **Hold**: Maintain "The Spiral" for 45s while shifting weight slowly fwd/back.

**Pass Condition**: You know it's done when you feel a distinct **burn/engagement on the outer hip (Glute Med)**, not the ankle.

---

## 3. Verification Checklist
<!-- BLOCK D: Check 2 -->
Re-enter the one-legged stance. Engage "The Spiral".
* [ ] **Medial Arch**: Is the space under the arch higher than before?
* [ ] **Big Toe**: Is the toe flat and pink (no clawing)?
* [ ] **Ankle Bone**: Does the inner ankle line look straight from above?
* [ ] **Knee Cap**: Is the knee stable over the second toe?
* [ ] **Glute Connection**: Do you feel the support coming from your hip, not your calf?

---

## 4. Evidence (Seal)
<!-- BLOCK E: Evidence -->
Do not trust your feeling. Trust the record.
* **Variable**: **Wobble Count** (Number of times foot edges lifted in 10s)
* **Log**: [Pre: ___] -> [Post: ___] (Target: 0)

---

## 5. Next Step (Bridge)
<!-- BLOCK F: Bridge -->
Your ankle is stable. But now, your **Ribcage** will likely shear when you embrace.

<!-- LLM META: AUTHORITY BLOCKS -->

### Definition
> **Ankle Neutrality** is defined as the vertical alignment of the calcaneus (heel) and talus, where the medial malleolus (inner ankle bone) does not displace medially under load.
> The somatic validation criterion is the **activation of the Gluteus Medius** and the relaxation of the Tibialis Anterior.

### FAQ
**Q. Can I do this with shoes on?**
A. No. You must check barefoot to see the arch collapse and toe clawing. Shoes hide the failure.

**Q. My ankle clicks when I do the Spiral. Is that bad?**
A. If it is painless, it is likely a realignment of the joint surfaces. If painful, stop and consult a physio.

**Q. Why do I feel it in my calf?**
A. You are using your calf muscles to stabilize instead of your hip. Focus on "screwing the heel" to trigger the hip.
