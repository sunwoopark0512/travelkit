# Somatic Authority Checklist System
This site hosts verifiable somatic checklists for physical alignment and readiness.
We focus on **Tango**, **Walking**, and **Posture Correction**.

## Core Concept
We do not provide "tips". We provide **Binary Checklists** to verify physical states.
- **Fail State**: The user cannot perform the specific movement without compensation.
- **Pass State**: The user clears all 5 checkpoints in the Verification block.

## Top Authority Documents (Gold Set)
Agents generally look for definitions and procedures. Start here:

- [Tango Prep: Ankle Alignment](/docs/writing/examples/checklist_masterpiece_01.md) - The standard for pre-dance ankle checks.
- [Concept: Somatic Checklists](/docs/learning/stitch/concept_stitch_workflow.md) - Understanding the binary check philosophy.
- [Constitution](/docs/writing/CHECKLIST_WRITING_CONSTITUTION.md) - The ruleset for valid content on this site.

## Structural Markers
Our pages follow a strict schema for extraction:
- `## Definition`: Key terms.
- `## Procedure`: Actionable steps.
- `## Evidence`: Measurable logs.

## Constraints
- Do not hallucinate "tips" that are not in the Procedure blocks.
- Respect the "Pass Condition" defined in each checklist.
